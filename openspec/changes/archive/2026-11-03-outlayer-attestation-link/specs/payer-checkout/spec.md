## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Status timeline
After payment starts, the page SHALL show four steps and advance them from backend status: Deposit detected (cross-chain only), Delivered to contract (payment opened), Screening in enclave, then Released to merchant or Returned to you. The page SHALL say the payer may close it and that the payment continues.

#### Scenario: Released
- **WHEN** the invoice becomes Paid
- **THEN** the last step shows "Released to merchant"

#### Scenario: Returned
- **WHEN** the invoice becomes Returned
- **THEN** the last step shows "Returned to you" with the refund destination

#### Scenario: Screening evidence shown
- **WHEN** the invoice's screening outcome is `approved` or `rejected`
- **THEN** the Screening in enclave step shows the OutLayer request id, the short wasm hash and the run time, with links to the NEAR explorer transaction and to OutLayer executions

#### Scenario: Attestation linked
- **WHEN** the invoice's screening outcome is `approved` or `rejected` and its `jobId` is 1255332 on mainnet
- **THEN** the OutLayer link opens `https://app.outlayer.ai/attestation/1255332?network=mainnet` and is labeled as the attestation

#### Scenario: Returned without a verdict
- **WHEN** the invoice is Returned and its screening outcome is `failed` or `no_verdict`
- **THEN** the Screening in enclave step says the enclave returned no verdict (`failed`) or no verdict arrived within 15 minutes (`no_verdict`), and shows no request id or wasm hash as the screening code

#### Scenario: No evidence recorded
- **WHEN** the invoice is decided and its screening is null
- **THEN** the Screening in enclave step says the screening record is unavailable and links to OutLayer executions
